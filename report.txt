## **1. Abstract**

The **Smart Motion Detector with Analytics** is an intelligent, real-time surveillance system that integrates **motion detection, object recognition, and analytical visualization** through a web-based dashboard. The project leverages **OpenCV** for video processing, **Flask** for backend services, and **YOLOv8** for lightweight object classification.

The system captures live video from a webcam, detects and classifies motion events, generates heatmaps indicating areas of frequent activity, and provides live analytics via a modern, responsive web interface. This enables users to monitor environments dynamically and analyze motion trends efficiently.

---

## **2. Introduction**

Surveillance systems play a vital role in security, industrial monitoring, and research environments. However, most traditional systems only record footage without providing real-time insights or event-based analytics.

The **Smart Motion Detector with Analytics** aims to bridge this gap by offering:

* **Automated motion detection** using frame differencing and contour-based analysis.
* **Object classification** (e.g., person, vehicle, animal) using a pre-trained YOLOv8 model.
* **Real-time analytics dashboard** for visualization and control.
* **Heatmap visualization** to indicate zones with frequent movement.

This system ensures smarter surveillance by not just detecting motion, but **analyzing it intelligently**.

---

## **3. Objectives**

1. To design and implement a system capable of detecting motion in real time using computer vision.
2. To classify detected motion events using deep learning (YOLOv8).
3. To visualize live video feed, motion intensity charts, and heatmaps on a single unified dashboard.
4. To enable configurable parameters (threshold, motion area) for tuning performance.
5. To create a scalable backend architecture that supports data logging and real-time streaming (SSE).

---

## **4. System Overview**

### **4.1 System Architecture**

The architecture of the system consists of three major components:

1. **Video Processing Engine (OpenCV + YOLOv8)**

   * Captures live video frames.
   * Performs grayscale conversion, Gaussian blurring, and background subtraction.
   * Detects motion regions using thresholding and contour area filtering.
   * Optionally classifies moving objects using YOLOv8 lightweight neural network.

2. **Flask Backend (Event Handling & APIs)**

   * Manages API endpoints for live video feed, heatmap, and configuration updates.
   * Uses **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** for continuous streaming of motion logs and analytics.
   * Logs event data via an event bus mechanism for lightweight real-time communication.

3. **Web Dashboard (Frontend UI)**

   * Displays live camera feed using MJPEG streaming.
   * Shows real-time charts of motion intensity.
   * Displays recent motion event logs with timestamps and classifications.
   * Offers parameter tuning via sliders (threshold, minimum area).
   * Displays live motion heatmap updated periodically.

## **6. Methodology**

### **Step 1: Frame Acquisition**

The system captures frames from a webcam using OpenCV’s `VideoCapture()` method. Frames are resized to 480px width for optimal performance.

### **Step 2: Preprocessing**

Each frame undergoes grayscale conversion and Gaussian blurring to reduce noise and smoothen intensity transitions.

### **Step 3: Motion Detection**

A weighted average background model is maintained using:

```
cv2.accumulateWeighted(gray_frame, first_frame, 0.1)
```

Frame differencing and thresholding identify changes in the scene. Contours with an area greater than a defined `MIN_AREA` are treated as valid motion events.

### **Step 4: Object Classification**

If YOLOv8 weights are available, the system passes motion frames through the model to label detected entities (e.g., "Person", "Vehicle").

### **Step 5: Event Logging**

Events are logged with timestamps, duration, and classification using an event bus mechanism that asynchronously updates the analytics UI.

### **Step 6: Heatmap Generation**

The system accumulates binary masks of motion frames to create a **motion frequency heatmap**, normalized and color-coded using Matplotlib’s `hot` colormap.

### **Step 7: Visualization Dashboard**

The web dashboard visualizes:

* Live camera feed (`/video_feed`)
* Motion intensity chart (via SSE)
* Real-time event logs
* Dynamic motion heatmap (`/api/heatmap_image`)

## **7. System Workflow**

**1.** Camera stream captured via OpenCV
**2.** Motion detection executed frame by frame
**3.** Events logged and classified
**4.** Flask backend transmits live data via SSE
**5.** Dashboard updates visuals in real time
